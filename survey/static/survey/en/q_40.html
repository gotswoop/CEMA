<p>This next part is a little different from past surveys. You are getting $25 just for doing this survey. Next, you will decide between getting money and goods or services. Only one of your choices will be selected as the "choice-that-counts." If you picked money in that choice, it will be loaded on your card at <u>the end of the week</u>. If you picked the good or service in that choice, you will receive it at <u>the end of the week</u>.</p>
